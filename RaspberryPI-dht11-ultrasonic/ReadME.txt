In this project Raspberry Pi, dht11 and ultrasonic sensor are used.
dht11 measures temperature and humidity, ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
The temperature, humidity and distance data are mesured and stored in a time series database.
Influx DB is the time series database that I used in this project.
This project was a part of Digital Signal Processing course conducted by Prof. Lukasz Rojek
